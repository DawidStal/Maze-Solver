# Maze-Solver
The goal of the program is to escape from the maze. You are allowed 200 moves in the maze before you die. You will appear at some point in the maze but you don't know where. Each maze has exactly one exit. Each maze is a 20x20 grid consisting of walls and spaces. The program will print out the maze every time you make a step and 
then pause for 100ms. If you move into a wall, nothing happens but you lose a life. The program will terminate if you find the exit or lose all your lives.
